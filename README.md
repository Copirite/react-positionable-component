This is a WIP test repository at the moment.

Install for use in your own project with `npm install react-positionable-component`.

You'll probably want to use the `./style.css` file as positionable stylesheet,
or, alternatively, roll your own by looking at which rules are used for what.

For dev work on this code, clone, `npm install` and then to run, `npm run dev`.

Individual `npm run` tasks:

- build the code with `npm run build:pos` or `npm run build:app`
- watch the code with `npm run watch:pos` or `npm run watch:app`
- run a live-server with the `live-server` cli utility
